      When I first started my job at Ubisoft Montreal, I was part of a team in
      charge of maintaining a Single-Page Application for PlayStation 4 and Xbox
      One which was roughly five years old. The tech debt was quite big, I’ve
      decided to work on my free time to prepare a proof of concept with React
      in order to convince my teammates and the management that a fresh stack
      would increase our comfort, our productivity and the performance of the
      app.
      <br />
      I’ve made a presentation to point out how performance is important for the
      User Experience. I’ve done my best to make sure that even people without
      technical background can easily understand. I have shown them real
      examples and statistics in order to sensibilize them e.g.

      I’ve used tools such as Lighthouse and Webpagetest to show metrics of our
      application and I compared them with our competitors (e.g. Steam). I’ve
      mostly focused on file sizes, the app was shipping 651KB JS + 466KB CSS
      (gzipped) / 1.8MB JS + 1.1MB CSS (uncompressed). To explain why file size
      matters, I’ve introduced them concepts such as First Meaningful Paint and
      Time to Interactive. I also spent time to explain why image optimization
      is vital based on a HTTP Archive report. I’ve shown them an example of an
      image used on prod which had a size equal to 3.5MB. I used a simple tool
      called TinyPNG to compress it in front of them. People were amazed to see
      that I could reduce the image size by roughly 70% and keep the same
      quality.
      <br /> I’ve also spent time to explain that too many HTTP requests, the
      code was hard to maintain and new technologies like GraphQL or the BFF
      pattern could solve our issues. I’ve explained that we must track all
      those things with Google Analytics in order to base our future decisions
      and priorities on its reports. I also tried to introduce the concept of
      Design System and Atomic Design via Storybook and Figma.
