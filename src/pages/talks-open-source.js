      I contribute to the Web / JS community as much as I can. I love
      talking at local{' '}

      (Seoul, Tokyo and Montreal) or taking care of developers debuting in web
      development. E.g. I've made a list of{' '}
      <Anchor href="https://github.com/sylvhama/modern-js">free content</Anchor>{' '}

      . I also enjoy doing internal presentations or sharing articles to
      introduce new concepts or libraries to my teammates. I am also used to do
      pair programming to solve problems in a more efficient way.
